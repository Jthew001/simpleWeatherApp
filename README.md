# weather-app

Css and inital html taken from  https://github.com/subhroisback/weather-app/archive/master.zip

Serach using google api, using lat and long taken from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11033451/find-the-latitude-and-longitude-using-javascript (author Abhishek)

The app now will ask for location and if access is denied then it will display text saying enter your location (not preferable, but becuase of firefox where if the user say don't give my location the load weather for a location won't work I coded it like mentioned to be consistant on any browser)

do git clone (my git url) and then open the index.html to see the app

Made using html, css and js
