# weather-app

Css and inital html taken from  https://github.com/subhroisback/weather-app/archive/master.zip

But, it only pulls from geolocation, so we need to build in a find my location and search functionality 

The idea I am pursuing now in the code in test.html the code taken from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11033451/find-the-latitude-and-longitude-using-javascript (author Abhishek)

double click on index.html to run the code, it will open a web browser

You can enter a location and click the serach button and it will return the weather at the location

This is not yet implemented into the html on the unix server
