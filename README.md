# simpleWeatherApp
Web app built for html using javascript and css

I created this app by taking a project from https://github.com/subhroisback/weather-app/archive/master.zip

and then adding the ability to serach for weather at a location using the goolge maps api to get lat and long of location given, in a simple looking web app

clone my repository and open the index.html to see the app 

This is still a work in progress, this is being made and modified for a class so I figured I woud share :)

Enjoy
